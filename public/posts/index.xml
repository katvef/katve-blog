      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came out as trans two days ago, ready to explore myself and find my place in the world – but then everything fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, my father told us he wanted a divorce. This had been a possibility for a long time, as there has been a lot of friction between my parents over the years, but only a few days ago my father said he &lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; want a divorce and things had progressed recently, so at least I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect this now. The situation escalated after I confronted my mother while agitated, trying to make her admit she hasn&amp;rsquo;t validated my emotions in my childhood – which has caused severe trauma and developmental issues. At one point during the heated conversation, my father came home. He was filled in, and eventually the discussion moved to their relationship. At this point, most others had already gone to bed as it was past midnight, but I stayed downstairs while my mother and father discussed, well it was more of an argument, but that&amp;rsquo;s the norm for them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
