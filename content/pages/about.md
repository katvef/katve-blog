title: About me
summary: Some info about me
---
After years of pushing through anxiety and depression while trying to act “normal”, I have finally decided it's time to change things and try to find out what place does the world have for this faggot. I am a pansexual transfeminine non-binary person only now starting her transition after years of trying to push away the feeling of not being a man and be what others wanted me to be. I have no grasp of who I am and feel like I change from moment to moment, especially based on the people I am with; I suspect this to be caused by BPD, but it could also simply be caused my upbringing and temperament or possibly the combination of <span style="text-decoration: underline;" title="ICD-11 isn't yet in use here in Finland, so a C-PTSD diagnosis isn't possible to get">C-PTSD</span>* and autism or some other shit. Currently waiting for neuropsychiatric studies due to suspected autism and hopefully will find out if I have any other personality disorders or similar. I have an ADHD diagnosis and have always been a bit weird, so this isn't surprising to me, I have even suspected I have something more severe for a good while. I go by any pronouns, but prefer *she* and *they*. I have always been called a boy and I *partly* identify with that at times, but not others so *he* is fine too. Neopronouns are a bit alien thing to me, but you can't say you don't like something if you haven't tried, right?
