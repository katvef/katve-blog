title: Love or Obsession
author: Katve

Love – a feeling I've never felt nor received.
Left alone with a frozen heart and a fear of abandonment.
But now I'm feeling this urge to hold onto someone – pull him closer and *never* let go.
Is it love, or am I just obsessed?

What is love? I don't even know!
I've never had a crush,
But no-one's ever cared me more!

I can't let him leave me
I want to pull him closer
What is this I am feeling?
I can't live without him,
But if I tell him,
Will he push me away?

I want to stay in his life
