## A seed of doubt
---
Every time I have a thought I fully believe it at first, but then a seed of doubt starts to take root
and make me doubt the thought. The doubt is, or at least seems, fully rational; it is a totally plausible
possibility, but not certain. After the doubt start to grow, new doubts and possibilities start to appear.
This all happens in a few seconds and usually makes me doubt myself so much I will forever be unsure
about the original thought.

Alone as a single instance, this is not really that big of an issue. But when it happens with **every**
thought, it gets overwhelming really quickly. I am unable to trust any thought I have. Everything has
multiple explanations, there may be some hidden motive, or I might just be straight up wrong. I don't
even know if the thought is mine and how much of it is masking, meaning if I had had the thought in order
to uphold the mask I've created and am currently presenting outwards. My masking is so strong it shadows
everything else; it's like I completely change as a person and adapt to my surroundings like a chameleon.

The worst kind of doubt is fully internal; me doubting if I really want something or just think I want
it. It tears you apart very easily when you can't tell if anything you think is real. Even when you
have a strong internal feeling, the strongest you've ever felt, you still doubt if it's real or not.
Even with **all** the evidence in the world in front of me, I still cannot trust myself.

Logic has become an extremely important thing to me, it's the only thing I can "trust". I **know** logic
is always right, but I doubt if my logic stands. Still, I need to pick something to trust, so I usually
go with the logic. Even that is difficult. When I go with the logic, I don't feel valid. The doubt is
so deep-rooted that I need external validation to truly feel valid about my thoughts, but asking for
validation would make me doubt if the source of validation actually thinks that or just says it because
I want them to.

I can hide most parts of myself I don't like, but a flat chest is rather difficult to hide, leading me
to constantly think to myself: "man, I'd look so much better in these clothes if I had breasts". Still,
I doubt if I _really_ want breasts or just think I do. In this specific case, logic says that I've had
this thought for _years_ and thus it's probably not just some fabrication of my mind, but something I truly
want. This specific thought applies to most of my thoughts about my gender, excluding those that seem
to change or are inconsistent over time.

A more annoying thing about this constant doubting is attempting to find a nefarious reason for every
nice action and an excuse or explanation for every bad thing someone has done. This leads me to forgive
bad actions for a good while and fear the true intentions behind the actions of even people close to
me, especially my parents, whose intentions I doubt the most and often think the main motivator behind
their actions is to be a good parent. It'd be nice to have even a single person I can fully trust and
rely on.

Sometimes I even have doubts about my doubts being _real_ doubts, or me just thinking I should doubt it
so that I fit what I think I should be like. I constantly work to be what I think I should be, without
ever knowing if that is actually me. I constantly need something to fill the void inside me, no matter
what it is or where it comes from. I doubt if who I think I am really is me. Since the need to fill the
void and mirror others is so great, I doubt if that what I think I am is me, or me just trying to fill
the void and making myself see these things in me which are not there.


## Mirror, Mirror, Who The Fuck Am I?
---
I do not have a proper sense of self. I only exist as what others want from me, my purpose is to fulfill
others wants and needs. It is as if I'm hollow and fill myself with everything I find around me. I must
be accepted. Who I am was not accepted, thus I discarded that identity and started mimicking others –
taking my identity from those around me. I noticed this behavior first in middle school when I started
studying myself, attempting to diagnose the reason behind it. After that, I have become a slave to my
fears; only doing actions that have no possibility of judgment and no chance of me being perceived negatively,
since that's what leads to abandonment.

In middle school, I studied others and how they acted, staying quiet in the background where I was present.
I only spoke what I knew would be accepted, parroting things others said, adopting their beliefs, and
simply being a reflection of what the group was. Only sounding my opinion if it aligned with the opinion
of others. This is mostly similar to what I believe many do when they are in a new environment where
they know no-one (especially at that age), but it was extreme to me. I did not show my true self even
after I was comfortable around my new friends, because I never was. My identity had become a commodity
I provided to others.

People pleasing is another thing that I find my fear of abandonment has incurred; if I am not liked,
I'll be abandoned, so I must make my self be liked. Being like others is one of the forms of people pleasing
I do; People like being with and are drawn to others like them. I do things for others that are actively
harmful to myself, such as transforming myself to what others want from a person, constantly ignoring
my own needs and wants in order to fulfill the wants and needs of others. I often push myself past my
limit for example, going to social events even when I would not have the energy because people want me
there, changing my identity in order to match what others want me to be, and working through anxiety
and depression, maybe even suppressing panic attacks to seem "normal".

All the doubting has caused me to want a person in my life who tells me what I'm supposed to be and do.
This feels conflicting to me, since I've always held being in control of your life at an extremely high
value, likely because I've never been in control of my life. It's like I'm just a passenger on raft floating
in the open ocean, and I have thalassophobia{{<info title="Fear of deep bodies of water">}}.
Now I realize I need the person to be someone who wants me to be me and I can trust has my best interest
in mind. I now understand this to be need for a strong mirror that wants me to be who I am.

My parents are not a good fit for the role; my need to be what others want has been partially caused
by them, especially my mother by proxy of her religion to which I was raised, where I was constantly
told what I should be like. I need the person to be someone I do _not_ have negative experiences with.


## Invalid
---
I rarely, if ever, feel valid. My emotions having never been validated and me always changing myself
in order to fit what others want of me have likely contributed a lot to this. My emotions are mine and
I've hidden them and felt them alone for my whole life, so that isn't something I think of daily, but
it would be really nice if they were validated instead of being ignored, minimized, and reframed.

A highly difficult thing for me is that I feel my gender is invalid. I feel like I'm not doing enough
to present as the correct gender and because people don't see me as the gender I am, I can't present
as that gender (due to the mirroring and need to be what others want me to be).

To be my true self, I think I need that to be something others want. Knowing that is what others want
is not enough, they need to tell me that what I want to be is what they want. Not just be told "we want
you to be yourself", but specifically be told the exact things _I_ want is what _they_ want. Though directly
requesting this would make it feel fake and thus I would be unable to accept it.

I find most my actions to be rooted in me needing to be liked by others, since if I'm not liked, I'm
abandoned. I need to ensure that no-one feels any negative emotion because of me, since that may cause
me not to be liked. This explains why I don't want anyone to think I like someone else more, since that
may cause envy. I feel like my value to others is what I provide them, not what I am. What I am feels
more like a commodity I provide to others than a proper part of myself. I _want_ to be able to be who I
really am, but it feels impossible unless I get constant support and validation from others, especially
people important to me.

I don't like talking about my lack of self-worth and feelings that I don't deserve help since my expectation
is that I will be told "You are important!" or "But you do deserve help!". I don't need to be told that;
I know that through logic. I need others to see me and make me feel like I'm worth something; I need
people to make me <span class="float" style="--float-dur:2s;--float-min:1px;--float-rot:5deg;">feel</span>
like I deserve help.

I hate receiving things I have not gained through my efforts, but I like giving things to others. Or
to be more accurate: I like giving things to others since it improves their view on me; increasing my
worth and giving them a reason to keep me around for a while longer.

</p>

I constantly have intrusive thoughts and they get overwhelming easily. I fear I might do some of the
actions and I believe every thought. The thoughts about killing myself are ever present and if I distract
myself, they come back at random moments. The thoughts are mine, they are said by some other voice that's
not me, but is a part of me. It's like there's a little demon living inside my head – a manifestation
of the "{{<spans text="bad" class="shaky-1">}}" parts of me. I do not wish to commit these actions, but
the urge is great when I hear the voice.

I'm afraid I might commit some of these actions. I'm ashamed of myself and afraid of everything I could
do if I lost control. I subconsciously learnt to freeze when I experience a strong negative emotion,
such as anxiety, anger, or annoyance (which are practically the same to me as I experience emotions in
extremes). When I freeze, it is incredibly distressing; the helplessness and lack of control caused by
not being able to move your body is incredibly distressing.

"I am **disgusting**", "I am **repulsive**.", "**No-one** would want to be with me if they knew what goes on in my
head". I truly believe these thoughts. I am an absolute and utter failure worthless of life. I do not
have a single drop of self-worth left, all my worth comes from other people and external validation.
If I do not achieve something or give someone something, be that something physical, psychological, or
social, I feel like I'm not doing enough.

I have a ton of self-hate that has built up over the years, a ton of which is caused by my executive
dysfunction. Each time I fail to do something before a deadline, I punish myself by, for example, verbally
abusing myself, banging my head against a wall, hitting myself, but that doesn't usually help, so the
shame is left to grow and build up. All this shame and self-hate has torn my self-worth into nothingness.


## Please Like Me!
---
As I told, I **need** others to like me, I **need** people close to me, I **need** to have at least _some_ sort of
human interaction, I **need** external validation. This combined with my doubting of everybody's intentions
and fear of abandonment leads me to an _extremely_ enjoyable experience with people. I want to pull people
ever closer but fear their closeness, because they could abandon me at any moment or might use my vulnerability
as a weapon against me. I've learnt that it's safest to stay closed and never be vulnerable, but luckily
I have some great friends and finally have people I can now be more open with – though the fear is still
there, stronger even.

Now that I have opened to my friends and actually have people I think could care about me as my friends,
I fear I am being used for amusement or something else in my friend group and only kept around because
that provides them something. That has been what I've always done to keep myself from being abandoned –
provide to others a person they enjoy, so you won't be left alone – but now I fear that is the only reason
I'm not abandoned. A torn up piece of shit like me may be fun to build up and then tear down – maybe
I'm just a toy to them. This fear seems irrational even to _me_, but they are impossible to be left without
attention and I constantly struggle to fight it. I try to ignore it, but that feels **impossible**.

A thing I've noticed is that I don't want anyone to think I like someone more than someone else. I think
it might be because I think if others know I like someone better, then they would like me less or be
envious, which means that **I** have caused someone else to feel a negative emotion. Someone feeling a negative
emotion because of me is not something I want; I'm supposed to make others feel <i style="color: mediumseagreen;">better</i>, not <i style="color: indianred;">worse</i>.

I am _afraid_. It's like I'm hanging on a thread held by others and having no independence – I am beholden
to my friends and could not survive on my own. This increases my need to give them so much more – yet,
I'm in such a bad condition that I'm unable to provide all but my company and continued living. I don't
currently have any other reason to live, other than the fact that there is someone who means something
to me and want me to live. I'm afraid that the thread could be cut at any moment, but still hopeful of
the fact that things can change. I _can_ still get better. I am _not_ alone in this world.


## Afterword
---
I've put much more effort to writing this post than any other posts yet and wish to keep the length and
quality at this level. It takes a lot longer to write like this, but the higher quality helps the reader
understand the meaning and emotion behind the words better. I will still do shorter posts in between, but
try to do _at least_ one longer post per month.

Something specifically about this post is that I noticed I over explained a lot, which is caused directly
by my want to be understood correctly, as I've often been misunderstood and if people don't know the
reason behind everything, they may read my actions or intentions as evil. People are difficult and a
single sentence may have multiple meanings depending on the person.

I've also been thinking of adding a comment section, but haven't had the time or interest to add it.
I also might not want everyone to be able to comment under these posts, as the content is quite sensitive.
