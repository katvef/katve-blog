## A seed of doubt
---
Every time I have a thought I fully believe it at first, but then a seed of doubt starts to take root
and make me doubt the thought. The doubt is, or at least seems, fully rational; it is a totally plausible
possibility, but not certain. After the doubt start to grow, new doubts and possibilities start to appear.
This all happens in a few seconds and usually makes me doubt myself so much I will forever be unsure
about the original thought.

Alone as a single instance, this is not really that big of an issue. But when it happens with **every**
thought, it gets overwhelming really quickly. I am unable to trust any thought I have. Everything has
multiple explanations, there may be some hidden motive, or I might just be straight up wrong. I don't
even know if the thought is mine and how much of it is masking, meaning if I had had the thought in order
to uphold the mask I've created and am currently presenting outwards. My masking is so strong it shadows
everything else; it's like I completely change as a person and adapt to my surroundings like a chameleon.

The worst kind of doubt is fully internal; me doubting if I really want something or just think I want
it. It tears you apart very easily when you can't tell if anything you think is real. Even when you
have a strong internal feeling, the strongest you've ever felt, you still doubt if it's real or not.
Even with **all** the evidence in the world in front of me, I still cannot trust myself. Logic has become
an extremely important thing to me, it's the only thing I can "trust". I **know** logic is always right,
but I doubt if my logic stands. Still, I need to pick something to trust, so I usually go with the logic.
Even that is difficult. When I go with the logic, I don't feel valid. The doubt is so deep-rooted that
I need external validation to truly feel valid about my thoughts, but asking for validation would make
me doubt if the source of validation actually thinks that or just says it because I want them to.

I can hide most parts of myself I don't like, but a flat chest is rather difficult to hide, leading me
to constantly think to myself: "man, I'd look so much better in these clothes if I had breasts". Still,
I doubt if I _really_ want breasts or just think I do. In this case, logic says that I've had this thought
for _years_ and thus is probably not just some fabrication of my mind, but something I truly want. This
specific thought applies to most of my thoughts about my gender, excluding those that seem to change
or are inconsistent over time.


## Mirror, Mirror
---
I do not have a proper sense of self. I only exist as what others want from me, my purpose is to fulfill
others wants and needs. It is as if I'm hollow and fill myself with everything I find around me. I must
be accepted. Who I am was not accepted, thus I discarded that identity and started mimicking others –
taking my identity from those around me. I noticed this behavior

To be my true self, I think I need that to be something others want. Knowing that is what others want
is not enough, they need to tell me that what I want to be is what they want. Not just be told "we want
you to be yourself", but specifically be told the exact things _I_ want is what _they_ want. Though directly
requesting this would make it feel fake and thus I would be unable to accept it.


## Invalid
---
I rarely, if ever, feel valid. My emotions having never been validated and me always changing myself in order to
fit what others want of me have likely contributed a lot to this. My emotions are mine and I've hidden
them and felt them alone for my whole life, so that isn't something I think of daily, but it would be
really nice if they were validated instead of being ignored, minimized, and reframed.

</p>

I constantly have intrusive thoughts and they get overwhelming easily. I fear I might do some of the
actions and I believe every thought. The thoughts about killing myself are ever present and if I distract
myself, they come back at random moments.

I don't like talking about my lack of self-worth and feelings that I don't deserve help since my expectation
is that I will be told "You are important!" or "But you do deserve help!". I don't need to be told that,
I know that through logic. I need you to see me and make me feel like I'm worth something; I need you
to make me <span class="float" style="--float-dur:2s;--float-min:1px;--float-rot:5deg;">feel</span>
like I deserve help.
