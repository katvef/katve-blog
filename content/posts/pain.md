title: Pain
summary: I love pain. I want to suffer.

## Pain <span class="heart-beat">&hearts;</span>
I {{< spans text="love" class="wave" style="--wave-dur:1.3s; --wave-top:8px; --wave-bottom:-2px;" >}} pain. Pain is pleasure. I want to suffer. I want to see myself
bleed. I want to see all the blood flow. I want to hear myself scream. I want to see my body torn and
mangled. I deserve to suffer. I want to be hurt. I want to be used. I want to lose all control and be
told what to do. I {{< spans text="hate" class="shaky" >}} myself.


## Pain is good
From an extremely young age, I was interested in pain. I don't know why or when exactly this started,
but I remember myself just pushing through pain and trying to be strong – I think that contributed
at least a bit to me enjoying pain. Feeling pain just makes me feel euphoric – a pleasure you can't
feel any other way. It overwhelms your mind and takes you over, pushing away all other feelings. The
only thing you have to concentrate on is the pain; no more worries or suffering – you can just bask
in the pain and let it be the only thing you have to think about.

The easiest way to make myself happy is thinking of images of me being cut into pieces, beaten up,
hearing myself cry and scream for the pain to stop, anything where I am permanently hurt. I know that
having these things actually happen to me would permanently affect my body and make everything harder,
but my brain doesn't care about that – this body deserves to suffer, _it's not good enough_. Also, I
_do **not**_ enjoy gore, it's only me suffering that I enjoy. In fact, gore and screams of pain are unsettling
to me; they make me feel anxious and uncomfortable. Looking at gore makes me want to puke. (Unless it's
drawn, in which case I have no reaction and it doesn't bother me at all)

I don't remember the year (as I do not for almost anything) when I started self harming, but it was sometime
during primary school between the grades one and four. It started with me beating my things and banging
my head against a wall, but I wanted something more, I wanted something stronger, I wanted to see my body
{{< spans text="bleed" class="shaky-2" style="--shaky-dur:1s; color: darkred;" >}}. As a result of that,
I started cutting. I liked when I saw the blood come out – it made me happy. If I could do this to my body,
I could do anything. But my parents caught me because I was in a room that others walk through constantly
and had practically no privacy (very good for the mental health of a child /s).

Seeing the blood was nice, but it was annoying since it left marks, I had to wait for the blood to stop
coming out, and it could get things dirty. The scars weren't deep thought, they healed quickly on the
first time and no permanent marks were left. But I didn't care about any of this the second time I started
cutting; I was in too much pain to care and **had** to start cutting. I have since stopped again, but
it's hard. I constantly have the urge to cut, but I don't want to have the scars anymore since others
don't think they look "sexy".

The second time I started cutting, I cut
{{< spans text="deep" class="steps" style="--step:1px; --initial-steps:1" >}} – as deep as I could.
I wanted to feel some proper **pain**. It started when I had a really severe panic attack. It lasted for
so long I couldn't take it anymore. I don't remember how long it took until I started cutting that time,
but it was after the first or second hour of the panic attack. After that, I started cutting when I felt
bad, and I felt bad _often_. I cut almost daily. I've stopped cutting again, as I mentioned earlier, but
I still want to do it.

## Too much
When I traverse my mind while exploring my thoughts, [all I hear are screams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyqul8pKHko&t=43s).
They **{{< spans text="hurt!" class="shaky-1" >}} –
{{< spans text="I" class="shaky-1" >}} {{< spans text="DON'T" class="shaky-2" >}}
{{< spans text="WANT" class="shaky-3" >}} {{< spans text="THEM!" class="shaky-4" >}}**
{{< spans text="I just want them to stop." class="shaky-1"
style="--shaky-dur:20s; vertical-align: -2px; opacity: 85%;" >}}
I don't want to be plagued with these screams and cries for the rest of my life. All the pain
in my mind is like my mind being flayed – torn into a million pieces and stitched together into a new
form **every second**. The pain is so great that there aren't many things that can push it away. The
easiest way to push it away is physical pain.

When I am overwhelmed by some emotion such as anxiety, depression, or having a panic attack. Physical
pain is the easiest way to ground myself and hold me together; to keep others safe from me, and me safe
from others. Physical pain is never too much, and I constantly keep pushing my limits and testing myself.
Because of this, it's easy for me to keep going after I've hit my limit when running, for example, but
it still takes a lot of discipline; which is a thing I lack with most other things. It takes too much
effort to pull yourself out of bed sometimes. I _could_ do it, but I just don't have the energy to force
myself.

Scars on my body are nice to look at and touch; the deeper, the better. They make me feel powerful and
in control. They make me feel _happy_. They also make it easier to look at my disgusting body – they
pull the focus from everything that is wrong with this lump of flesh I'm forced to live in. I haven't
self harmed in a few weeks now. The urges are strong, but I need to find better coping mechanisms.
Writing this blog has helped a lot with the urges, as I can get the emotions out of my body and they
don't get to pile up to the uncontrollable mess it has been for years.



## Afterword
I tried to use some more styling this time. Had to learn a bit of CSS, but I think it improves the
look of the post. It adds a bit more action to the otherwise plain text. I made an effort to not use
any JavaScript, which made everything harder. I'll probably try to use more styling and write
more CSS to make the site more {{< spans text="unique." class="wave" style="--wave-top:8px;" >}}
