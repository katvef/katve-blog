title: WIP â€“ Mind and Body Disconnected
summary: More talk about my dysphoria and how it affects me psychologically
---
## Introduction
My gender dysphoria is extremely strong, and over time, it has grown just stronger. Currently, it's so bad that I feel like I'm disconnected from my body. I might be thinking about something or doing something, and suddenly this feeling that this body is wrong just comes over me like a wave of emotions and I feel distant from my body; It's like I'm pushed out of the body and just looking out from a window through my eyes. I can still move my body (if I'm not too anxious and lose control of my body), but it feels unreal.
