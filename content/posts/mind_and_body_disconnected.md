title: Mind and Body Disconnected
summary: More talk about me being trans and how it affects me psychologically
---
## Disconnected
My gender dysphoria is extremely strong, and over time, it has grown just stronger. Currently, it's
so bad that I feel like I'm disconnected from my body. I might be thinking about something or doing
something, and suddenly this feeling that this body is wrong just comes over me like a wave of emotions
and I feel distant from my body; It's like I'm pushed out of the body and just looking out from a window
through my eyes. A better way to describe the feeling would be to say it's like being in
<span style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Virtual Reality">VR</span>,
but most people don't know how it feels I can still move my body (if I'm not too anxious and lose
control of my body), but it feels unreal.

Dissociation and depersonalization seem to become more common by the day. Looking in the mirror is
difficult – all I see is a handsome person that I am not. I don't want to be handsome, I want to be
pretty and beautiful. I don't see myself in the mirror, I don't even see what I want to be in my mind,
I see a constantly changing dark mess with a vaguely humanoid shape. It hurts to see myself like this,
it just makes me want to die. I don't see a world where any of this has a good ending, so all I can
do is hope. All the hopelessness makes me want to kill myself, but I try to persist. There is still
hope, I know it, I'm just unable to see it.

The societal expectations I've strongly tried to follow over the years due to some childhood trauma
likely caused by my mother not validating my emotions when I, for example, had a tantrum (I have always
experienced my emotions only in extremities), I learned that it was wrong to experience emotions and
learned to internalize my emotions and act "normal". This masking has become extremely strong and made
me completely unable to act how I want in a social situation, unless I'm under the influence of alcohol
when my anxiety is near nonexistent. Getting wasted for the first time with my friends was the first
time I was able to properly be myself. I've now told my friends about me being trans, so hopefully
I'll be able to be myself more, but it still feels difficult and anxiety inducing due to the previously
mentioned trauma.

Another thing that randomly happens to me is complete dissociation. I am fully inside my mind and do
not see anything expect my thoughts, I still hear, but I don't focus on that. Touch is another thing
that just disappears for me as I fully dive inside my mind and think about things or scenarios. This
is usually unintentional, but sometimes I seek this sensation as it's easier to process things when
I don't have any distractions. Returning to "the real world" is an odd feeling. Doing this dissociation
has made the line between reality and my mind blur even more. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but
sometimes I feel like I'm fully immersed in a video, a book, or even another person, and it becomes my
whole reality. I'm not entirely sure where I end and where the world begins – everything feels like a blur.

Most of my free time is wasted on thinking about death. I process my feelings and emotions most effectively
alone in my room disconnected from everything else in the world. Well, most effectively may be a bit
much to say, since I haven't really tried anything else before. Intellectualizing your emotions is often
actually a response to you suppressing your emotions and not learning how to *feel* them. The only emotion
that I can feel is anxiety – the physical effects are too strong not to notice.


## Afterword
This is a bit shorter than the previous posts, and I might extend this later a bit, but right now I just
want to get this out. It's been waiting for 3 days to be finished and I just haven't had the time and
energy. Hopefully I can get some more posts done next week.
