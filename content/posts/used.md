title: Used
description: My father is getting a divorce and has made me feel used.
---
## Introduction
---
I came out as trans two days ago, ready to explore myself and find who I am – but then everything fell apart.


## The Story
---
Yesterday, my father told us he wanted a divorce. This had been a possibility for a long time, as
there has been a lot of friction between my parents over the years, but only a few days ago my father
said he *didn't* want a divorce and things had progressed recently, so at least I didn't expect this now.
The situation escalated after I confronted my mother while agitated, trying to make her admit she hasn't
validated my emotions in my childhood – which has caused severe trauma and developmental issues. At
one point during the heated conversation, my father came home. He was filled in, and eventually the
discussion moved to their relationship. At this point, most others had already gone to bed as it was
past midnight, but I stayed downstairs while my mother and father discussed, well it was more of an
argument, but that's the norm for them.

Eventually their arguing culminated in my father saying he wanted a divorce. I went to sleep after
letting the info sink in for a few hours, and when I woke up at roughly 10:50, my father had told my
sisters about the situation. This led to an over 7 hours long discussion about the future of our family.
My older brother was woken up and called to join, and my older sister was picked up from her house
after a few hours. The situation was extremely difficult for the youngest two, but others handled it
pretty well initially.

Before this my father and I used to talk about my mother and how her actions have damaged us. I was
always a bit hesitant and uncomfortable during these discussions since it felt wrong to talk about
her wife and my mother behind her back, but speaking about these things to her would just lead to a
fruitless argument which would waste hours, so this was the easiest way to talk to someone about these
things. Now I feel I was used by my father to gain validation for his agenda against my mother.

I don't feel like he wanted to help me handle my problems, but acquire ammunition to use against her.
Now everything he has done for me feels reframed as somehow being for his gain. For example now I feel
like he wanted to do things with me not because I needed it and he should do it as a father, but
because he felt bad for himself for not doing it earlier in my life and wanted to feel like a good
father. He has always tried to make amends for his previous actions and I felt it was honest and was
happy he tried to act better, but now it seems like he only did it because he wanted to feel better
about himself.

I don't think I'm able to properly trust anyone anymore. I'll always question their motivation and
feel like I might be being manipulated or used somehow, even when there may not be any reason to
believe so. Even those I trust the most, which have never been my parents, are harder to trust. What
if they help me for their own gain and not because they care about me? What if I'm just a means to an
end – a tool. Worthless and disposable. My self-worth has been severely damaged by my father's actions
and I feel unclean. <s>I will **not** say that this is anywhere close to being raped, but I think I understand
how rape victims feel a little better now.</s> I don't think he even truly understands the depth of the
damage he has caused to his children, not only with the divorce but also with his emotional absence
and all his other actions.

My father had been very close to me, but now he feels distant to me, but he acts as if everything is
fine. He was incredibly important to me, but I don't think I can ever trust him properly again. I wish
things could be better, but it will take a lot of therapy for me to get over these feelings and my
relationship with my father will never be the same again. It will be forever clouded by the damage he
has caused me. I will never again think of him as my protector, but instead as the man who ruined my trust.

Luckily, I have friends I can trust – hopefully at least. They seem nice and are the only people I
have left, apart from my siblings. They have been there for me in my times of need, unlike my parents
who don't know how to support their children who are severely depressed and invalidate their emotions.


## Afterword
----
There are still a few things that are missing from this, for example, how I have never felt like my
parents actually care about me and how they are emotionally inept and broken people unfit to care for
their children's emotions, as can be seen by all their children being depressed at some point of their
lives, three having attempted suicide and four having been hospitalized.

16.10.2025 : I do not like keeping this up anymore since my feelings now somewhat diverge, but I think
having the emotions that I felt at the moment recorded be a good thing because I don't remember my thoughts
during that time otherwise.
