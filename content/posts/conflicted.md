## Introduction
---
I have always had conflicting emotions regarding some things; they seem to change suddenly and over time without any discernible logic. This has caused difficulties in choosing and doing things, leading me to often ignore my problems and just carry on. Now that I'm trying to face my emotions and deal with them, this struggle has become ever more prevalent.

In the [previous post](https://blog.katvef.fi/posts/used/), I talked about my feeling of being used by my father to gain validation for himself and feeling like everything he has done was for his own benefit. I also told that my father is very close to me. This combination has caused a lot of difficult emotions and internal conflicts. I have also noticed my brain attempting to forget everything and act like everything is fine and nothing has happened, but I consciously fight this want and am attempting to process the situation. I wish I could act like nothing happened, but things are going to change and that would simply cause more damage.


## The Situation
---
I love my father and I think he loves me, but I feel so conflicted. I think he truly loves me and meant no harm, but deep inside I have this feeling that I shouldn't trust him. When I imagine him in my mind, at one moment he is my loving father, and at another he is the monster who has used me. I try to forget everything, but I won't let myself. I will not allow my mind to play tricks on me anymore – I will force myself to remember so that I can avoid this happening again, but at the same time I feel like I have already forgiven him. I do not want to forgive him, but how would I know his motives? Why should I assume the worst? Deep down I believe he had good intentions, but my brain also says he did it for himself. All his actions may have been at least in part for me, but I **know** he did everything for himself. I don't know how much of his actions have been of true love. I know he wants to act better than his parents, but I don't know if it is for him or for us – his children.
