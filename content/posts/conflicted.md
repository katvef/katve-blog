## Introduction
---
I have always had conflicting emotions regarding some things; they seem to change suddenly and over time without any discernible logic. This has caused difficulties in choosing and doing things, leading me to often ignore my problems and just carry on. Now that I'm trying to face my emotions and deal with them, this struggle has become ever more prevalent.

In the previous post, I talked about my feeling of being used by my father to gain validation for himself and feeling like everything he has done was for his own benefit. I also told that my father is very close to me. This combination has caused a lot of difficult emotions and internal conflicts. I have also noticed my brain attempting to forget everything and act like everything is fine and nothing has happened â€“ but I consciously fight this want and am attempting to process the situation. I wish I could act like nothing happened, but things are going to change and that would simply cause more damage.
