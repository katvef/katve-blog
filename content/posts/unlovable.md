## Introduction
I feel unlovalbe. I feel like there isn't any reason for anyone to love me or care about me in any way.
I provide nothing to others and being with someone as weird as me can even be a hinderance to others.
To put it simply: all I give is suffering.


I want to have people close to me, but having people close to me is scary because tey might leave me
and it'd hurt even more.
